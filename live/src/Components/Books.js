    <p>How	to	Stick	with	Good	Habits	Every	Day
I
N	1993 ,	a	bank	in	Abbotsford,	Canada,	hired	a	twenty-three-year-old
stockbroker	named	Trent	Dyrsmid.	Abbotsford	was	a	relatively	small
suburb,	tucked	away	in	the	shadow	of	nearby	Vancouver,	where	most
of	the	big	business	deals	were	being	made.	Given	the	location,	and	the
fact	that	Dyrsmid	was	a	rookie,	nobody	expected	too	much	of	him.	But
he	made	brisk	progress	thanks	to	a	simple	daily	habit.
Dyrsmid	began	each	morning	with	two	jars	on	his	desk.	One	was
filled	with	120	paper	clips.	The	other	was	empty.	As	soon	as	he	settled
in	each	day,	he	would	make	a	sales	call.	Immediately	after,	he	would
move	one	paper	clip	from	the	full	jar	to	the	empty	jar	and	the	process
would	begin	again.	“Every	morning	I	would	start	with	120	paper	clips
in	one	jar	and	I	would	keep	dialing	the	phone	until	I	had	moved	them
all	to	the	second	jar,”	he	told	me.
Within	eighteen	months,	Dyrsmid	was	bringing	in	$5	million	to	the
firm.	By	age	twenty-four,	he	was	making	$75,000	per	year—the
equivalent	of	$125,000	today.	Not	long	after,	he	landed	a	six-figure	job
with	another	company.
I	like	to	refer	to	this	technique	as	the	Paper	Clip	Strategy	and,	over
the	years,	I’ve	heard	from	readers	who	have	employed	it	in	a	variety	of
ways.	One	woman	shifted	a	hairpin	from	one	container	to	another
whenever	she	wrote	a	page	of	her	book.	Another	man	moved	a	marble
from	one	bin	to	the	next	after	each	set	of	push-ups.
Making	progress	is	satisfying,	and	visual	measures—like	moving
paper	clips	or	hairpins	or	marbles—provide	clear	evidence	of	your
progress.	As	a	result,	they	reinforce	your	behavior	and	add	a	little	bit	of
immediate	satisfaction	to	any	activity.	Visual	measurement	comes	inmany	forms:	food	journals,	workout	logs,	loyalty	punch	cards,	the
progress	bar	on	a	software	download,	even	the	page	numbers	in	a
book.	But	perhaps	the	best	way	to	measure	your	progress	is	with	a
habit	tracker.
HOW	TO	KEEP	YOUR	HABITS	ON	TRACK
A	habit	tracker	is	a	simple	way	to	measure	whether	you	did	a	habit.
The	most	basic	format	is	to	get	a	calendar	and	cross	off	each	day	you
stick	with	your	routine.	For	example,	if	you	meditate	on	Monday,
Wednesday,	and	Friday,	each	of	those	dates	gets	an	X.	As	time	rolls	by,
the	calendar	becomes	a	record	of	your	habit	streak.
Countless	people	have	tracked	their	habits,	but	perhaps	the	most
famous	was	Benjamin	Franklin.	Beginning	at	age	twenty,	Franklin
carried	a	small	booklet	everywhere	he	went	and	used	it	to	track
thirteen	personal	virtues.	This	list	included	goals	like	“Lose	no	time.	Be
always	employed	in	something	useful”	and	“Avoid	trifling
conversation.”	At	the	end	of	each	day,	Franklin	would	open	his	booklet
and	record	his	progress.
Jerry	Seinfeld	reportedly	uses	a	habit	tracker	to	stick	with	his	streak
of	writing	jokes.	In	the	documentary	Comedian,	he	explains	that	his
goal	is	simply	to	“never	break	the	chain”	of	writing	jokes	every	day.	In
other	words,	he	is	not	focused	on	how	good	or	bad	a	particular	joke	is
or	how	inspired	he	feels.	He	is	simply	focused	on	showing	up	and
adding	to	his	streak.
“Don’t	break	the	chain”	is	a	powerful	mantra.	Don’t	break	the	chain
of	sales	calls	and	you’ll	build	a	successful	book	of	business.	Don’t	break
the	chain	of	workouts	and	you’ll	get	fit	faster	than	you’d	expect.	Don’t
break	the	chain	of	creating	every	day	and	you	will	end	up	with	an
impressive	portfolio.	Habit	tracking	is	powerful	because	it	leverages
multiple	Laws	of	Behavior	Change.	It	simultaneously	makes	a	behavior
obvious,	attractive,	and	satisfying.
Let’s	break	down	each	one.
Benefit	#1:	Habit	tracking	is	obvious.Recording	your	last	action	creates	a	trigger	that	can	initiate	your	next
one.	Habit	tracking	naturally	builds	a	series	of	visual	cues	like	the
streak	of	X’s	on	your	calendar	or	the	list	of	meals	in	your	food	log.
When	you	look	at	the	calendar	and	see	your	streak,	you’ll	be	reminded
to	act	again.	Research	has	shown	that	people	who	track	their	progress
on	goals	like	losing	weight,	quitting	smoking,	and	lowering	blood
pressure	are	all	more	likely	to	improve	than	those	who	don’t.	One
study	of	more	than	sixteen	hundred	people	found	that	those	who	kept
a	daily	food	log	lost	twice	as	much	weight	</p>
